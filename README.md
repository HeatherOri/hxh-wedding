<h3>My Portfolio Website</h3>
          <p>
            I did this portfolio website by myself as well. Before I learn
            programming, I need to use other websites to build my portfolio. I
            really appreciate the fact that I decided to learn the knowledge of
            front-end engineering. I really enjoy doing coding work now.

          <h3>What I learned</h3>
          <p>
            Using Foundation clearing lightbox<br />
            Building fixed navbar at the lefthand site<br />
            Improving my HTML and CSS skills<br />
            Displaying websites in smaller screen<br />
